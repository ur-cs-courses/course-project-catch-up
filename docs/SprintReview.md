# Sprint Review 

## What we accomplished
- Creation of our class diagram
- Creation of our sequence diagrams

## What we did not accomplish
- Since these were the only things we promised, nothing went undone

## Things that went well
- Everyone submitted their work on time.
- Excellent collaboration and communication between the members.
- Went into depth in discussing the assignments and the structure of the project.
- Formed a safe environment to discuss individual ideas and approaches to the assignments.

## Things that did not go well
- Tasks were not completed until near the deadline, mostly due to meeting times being hard to find.
- First sprint did not follow many of the formal github practices.

## Future improvement 
- Start working on the assignments in advance in order to have more time to apply changes.
- Communicate more about scheduling and planning meetings
- Improve skills in using github and going through the proper routes to get work done.
