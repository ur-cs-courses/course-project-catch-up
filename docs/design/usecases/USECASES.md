### Team Contributions: 

Sofia Dimotsi - I asked for advice from my teammates on how the expected diagram of usecases 1, 2 and 3 should be and then proceed on creating the puml files for each usecase.

Israa Draz - I discussed the user stories with the group and proceed to the design of use case diagram for cases 4-6.

Jennie Campbell - I discussed the user stories and the designs with the group in our group chat and led the implementation and documentation of use case diagrams 7, 8, and 9.

Pierce Chancy - I discussed the user stories and the designs with the group in our group chat and led the implementation and documentation of use cases diagrams 10 and 11.  I also made gramattical and syntactical edits to the .puml and .md files, as well as led the update of .md files.
