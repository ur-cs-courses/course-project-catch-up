## Class Diagram

### Manager Class:
A class that represents the managers methods and objects. The manager is the user of the system or the manager of the building. The manager will be the one assignings robots to do jobs and will be able to view the status of all the robots. The manager class uses the Technician class, the Room class, and the Robot class.

### Team Contributions: 
Jennie Campbell - We spoke about the entirty of the class diagram and the methods for each class as a group. I create the Manager class in the puml document and added all of its methods that were discussed. I also added any relationships Manager had with other classes.
