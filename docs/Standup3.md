# Standup 3

# Team Contributions

Israa:  

Sofia: I worked with Israa on deciding how we are going to put into code our team's ideas for the technician and fleet classes. I implemented the fleet class and asked from Israa to go over it as I was checking her work on the technician class.

Jennie: I debugged all of the new code with Pierce and made sure that everything was working how we wanted it to. I wrote the test file that tests all of the code and shows the logic of how our functions work. 

Pierce: Led the implementation of a new class, building, and updates to the manager class that included new classes (technician, building, and fleet).  Jennie and I worked together on debugging all of this new code and ensuring that it works together as intended.  I also updated the diagrams to include changes and reviewed everyone's work.  

## What we accomplished
- Creation of our Technician, Fleet and Building class.
- Created cmake files and fitted the libraries to accomodate the new classes.
- Updated the designs to include changes.
- Included new test cases to our testing code.

## What we did not accomplish
- We accomplished everything that we have aimed for at this standup.
  
## Things that went well
- Everyone submitted their work on time.
- Started working on the assignments in advance and ended up having more time to apply changes.
- Excellent collaboration and communication between the members.
- Went into depth in discussing actual implementation of our designs.
- Improve skills in using github and going through the proper routes to get work done.
  
## Things that did not go well


## Future improvement 
- Work on the simulation.
- Work on implementing the command line and including log file.
