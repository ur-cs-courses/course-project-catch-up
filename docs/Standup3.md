Israa:  

Sofia:  

Jennie: I debugged all of the new code with Pierce and made sure that everything was working how we wanted it to. I wrote the test file that tests all of the code and shows the logic of how our functions work. 

Pierce: Led the implementation of a new class, building, and updates to the manager class that included new classes (technician, building, and fleet).  Jennie and I worked together on debugging all of this new code and ensuring that it works together as intended.  I also updated the diagrams to include changes and reviewed everyone's work.
