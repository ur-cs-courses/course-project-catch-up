# Standup 3

# Team Contributions

Israa: I worked with sofia on technicien and fleet classes. we discussed ways of adding new functionality to technicien to make it more felxible and to fleet as well. I implemented technicien and reviwed Sofias fleet class. 

Sofia: I worked with Israa on deciding how we are going to put into code our team's ideas for the technician and fleet classes. I implemented the fleet class and asked from Israa to go over it as I was checking her work on the technician class.

Jennie: I debugged all of the new code with Pierce and made sure that everything was working how we wanted it to. I wrote the test file that tests all of the code and shows the logic of how our functions work. 

Pierce: Led the implementation of a new class, building, and updates to the manager class that included new classes (technician, building, and fleet).  Jennie and I worked together on debugging all of this new code and ensuring that it works together as intended.  I also updated the diagrams to include changes and reviewed everyone's work.  

## What we accomplished
- Creation of our Technician, Fleet and Building class.
- Created cmake files and fitted the libraries to accomodate the new classes.
- Updated the designs to include changes.
- Included new test cases to our testing code.

## What we did not accomplish
- We accomplished everything that we have aimed for at this standup.
  
## Things that went well
- Everyone submitted their work on time.
- Started working on the assignments in advance and ended up having more time to apply changes.
- Excellent collaboration and communication between the members.
- Went into depth in discussing actual implementation of our designs.
- Improve skills in using github and going through the proper routes to get work done.
  
## Things that did not go well
mainly it was challneging to decide what to do with the classes we had especially that we thought of adding new functionality and had to review all our previous functions and classes to accommodate the changes. Even though it took a little bit of extra time, eventally that was resolved. 

## Future plans 
- Work on the simulation.
- Work on implementing the command line and including log file.
